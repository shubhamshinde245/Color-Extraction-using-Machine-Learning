# Color-Extraction-using-Machine-Learning
The project was to develop a machine learning model to extract colors from the logos. I have used a
machine learning algorithm, KMeans, to extract colors from a given image with OpenCV2 for image
manipulation, applied KMeans to identify the major colors and then plot the information using Matplotlib. I
have identified the majority 8 colors that exist in the image.
